    <p>
    Before I introduce myself, I would like to tell my purpose in creating this website. So, this website is for my first assignment in IMD 315 subject.

    Thus, here I want to share a little about myself. Name given is Tengku Nuramila Qistina Bt Tengku Azman. My nickname is Amila or Qistina.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'am originally from Terengganu but lived in Sepang, Selangor since childhood. In fact, I was born in Hospital Besar Besut on 15 November 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
    My family started moving to Kuala Lumpur when I was a baby. Based on my year of birth I'am 21 years old this years. Then, I has nine siblings. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Their are only one boy in my family, the others are girls. The boy is my brother. He is quite caring but annoying at the same time hehehehehe. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Before starting my diploma studies at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr> Rembau, I went to school at <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi">SMKBBST</abbr> Sepang, Selangor. I majored in literature while in school. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Then, I chose to further my studies by taking the Information Management field. Now, I'am a final year students and persistent to spend the final sem. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I consider myself to be a responsible and hardworking student. Furthermore, I have a large number of friends who are giving positive vibes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, I really enjoy studying at Rembau because most of my classmates are quite pleasant and willing to help. So blessed to know them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, I'am a highly eager learner, and I believe this is one of my strongest qualities. My friends describe me as a funny person. 
    </p>
    <p>
    When I meet new people, who are excited to meet me, I immediately feel at ease with them. Friendship is really important.
